npm run db:generate
npm run dev
```

Database commands:

npm run db:push
npm run db:migrate
npm run db:seed
```

## Repository structure
- `src/app/` route groups (`dashboard`, `tip`, `qr`, `admin`, `auth`)
- `prisma/` schema and seed scripts
- `scripts/` utilities (including QR generation)
- `android/` Capacitor Android project

## Practical next improvements
